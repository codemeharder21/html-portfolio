    <h1>Hi, I am Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I am an undergrad student of Jadavpur University who is currently
        pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering in the esteemed University. He has led a carefree life without having to handle responsibilities especially beacause all important jobs and chores at home are taken care of by my elder brother Rajarshi Bandyopadhyay who was also a student of the same university and graduated with a <strong>PPO</strong> from Amazon based in Bengaluru in the post of SDE1 which is quite the dream to most engineers of today.
